## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this four card feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass preprocessor

### What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS Grid and responsive design in this project.

I tried to include more semantic HTML tags and explore CSS Grid for the more complex layouts on the page.

I also built the mobile design first and used media queries to change the layout once screen sizes grew over 1000px.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to continue to familiarize myself with responsive design best practices and speed up my development.

### Useful resources

Resources that helped me with CSS Grid:  
- [CSS Tricks - Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
- [Learn CSS Grid](https://learncssgrid.com/)
- [Josh Comeau - An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This site is not only built really cool but was the most helpful for me due to its interactive examples and explanations! Definitely worth checking out.
